# Configuring Application Communication  

As we mentioned, pods communicate with each other using services. For this application, let's say we have a database endpoint named mongo-db-service that is used to communicate with the database.

<b><i>Configuring the Database Endpoint</i></b>   

But where do we actually configure this database endpoint or URL? Usually, this configuration is done in an application property file or some kind of external environment variable. Often, it is included inside the built image of the application.

<b><i>Handling Endpoint Changes</i></b>

For example, if the endpoint of the service or the service name changes (maybe from mongo-db-service to mongo-DB), you would need to adjust that URL in the application. Typically, this requires rebuilding the application with the new version, pushing it to the repository, pulling the new image into your pod, and restarting the whole thing.

<b><i>Simplifying Configuration with ConfigMap</i></b>  

This scenario is a bit tedious for a small change. To simplify this process, Kubernetes has a component called ConfigMap.

<b>What is ConfigMap?</b>  
ConfigMap is essentially an external configuration for your application. It usually contains configuration data like URLs of a database or other services that your application uses.

<b>How ConfigMap Works</b>  
  - In Kubernetes, you connect ConfigMap to the pod.
  - The pod receives the configuration data contained in ConfigMap.
  - If you need to change the endpoint name, you just adjust the ConfigMap, avoiding the need to rebuild and redeploy the entire application.

<b><i>External Configuration and Sensitive Information</i></b>  

<b>ConfigMap for External Configuration</b>  

External configuration can include various settings such as database URLs, usernames, and passwords that may change during the application deployment process. Using ConfigMap for these configurations simplifies the management and updates without needing to rebuild the application.  

<b>Limitations of ConfigMap</b>  
However, storing sensitive information like passwords or other credentials directly in a ConfigMap is not secure because ConfigMap stores data in plain text.  

<b><i>Using Secrets for Sensitive Data</i></b>  

To securely manage sensitive information, Kubernetes provides another component called Secret.

  - Secret vs. ConfigMap: A Secret is similar to a ConfigMap, but it is specifically designed to store sensitive data.
  - Secure Storage: The data in a Secret is stored in a base64-encoded format, which provides an additional layer of security compared to plain text.
  - Usage: You connect the Secret to the pod, and the pod can access and read the sensitive data securely from the Secret.
