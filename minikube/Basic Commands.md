### Start MiniKube Cluster

Our next step is to start Minikube.   
To do this, execute the following command:

```bash
minikube start
```

Running `minikube start` will set up a Kubernetes cluster on your local system.

Verify your minikube installation by running the below command:    
You will be able to see all are up and running.   

```bash
minikube status
```

### Basic commands

Since we have installed the MiniKube successfully, Let's try some basic commands.   
To check the version of kubernetes installed:

```bash
kubectl version
```

To check the status of the nodes:   

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Here is the command to get more detailed information about the nodes:   

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

To check the pod details:

```bash
kubectl get pod
```

As of now, I don't have any pods at the moment and that is why it is showing no resources.   

To list the services:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea68fe4a-d924-4a21-bd72-211fec679ac8)

From the output,   
  `Name: Kubernetes` This is the default kubernetes service.   
  `Type: Cluster IP` This is the default service type, which means the service is only accessible within the cluster.   
  `Cluster IP` The internal IP address of the service.    
  `External IP` The external IP address of the service.   
  `Ports` That the services are exposed.   
  `Age` How long it has been running.   

To see more details of a specific service:

```bash
kubectl describe service <service-name>
```

Since I don't have any deployment, I am going to create one.  

```bash
kubectl create deployment nginx-deployment â€”-image=nginx
```

`kubectl create deployment` tells kubernetes to create a deployment resources.   
`nginx-deployment` is the name that you are giving to the new deployment.   
`--image=nginx` specify the Docker image that Kubernetes will use to create the container(s) for the deployment.

To see the status of the deployment:   

```bash
kubectl get deployment
```

To display information about the ReplicaSets running in your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl get replicaset
```

To modify the configuration of an existing deployment, execute the below command:

```bash
kubectl edit deployment [deployment-node-name]
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba8a5248-119c-495e-ae30-9d33ba72655d)

This command will a configuration file with default values. You can make any changes as needed.   

To view the logs generated by a specific pod in a Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl logs [pod-name]
```

To delete a specific deployment in a Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl delete deployment [deployment name]
```
