# Kubernetes Components  

<i><b>Nodes and Pods</b></i>  

<b>Node  </b>

  - Node: A node is a single server, which can be either a physical machine or a virtual machine. It is part of a Kubernetes cluster and is where your applications run.

<b>Pod  </b>

- Pod: The smallest and simplest unit in Kubernetes, which represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.
- Abstraction over a Container: A pod is essentially a wrapper around one or more containers. This means it creates an environment where the container can run, adding an extra layer of abstraction.

<b>Relationship Between Pod and Container   </b>

- Abstraction over a Container: A pod is essentially a wrapper around one or more containers. This means it creates an environment where the container can run, adding an extra layer of abstraction.
- Interacting with Kubernetes: Instead of interacting directly with Docker (or any other container runtime), you interact with Kubernetes. Kubernetes manages the containers, allowing you to focus on deploying and managing your applications through Kubernetes rather than dealing with the container runtime directly.

In simple words, Kubernetes uses nodes (servers) to run applications. The smallest unit in Kubernetes is a pod, which is an abstraction layer over containers. This abstraction allows Kubernetes to manage containers without you needing to deal with the underlying container technology directly. You interact with Kubernetes, which handles the details of running containers, providing a consistent and flexible environment for your applications.  

# Explanation of Pods and Containers in Kubernetes

<b>Application Pod and DB Pod</b>  

- Application Pod: This is a pod running your main application container.
- DB Pod: This is a separate pod running your database container.  

<b>Typical Use of Pods</b>  

- One Container per Pod: Generally, a pod is meant to run a single application container. This means each pod usually containes just one container running your main application or service.

- Multiple Cntainers in One Pod
    - When to use Multiple Containers: In some cases, a pod can contain multiple containers. This is usually done when you have:
      - Main App Container: The primary application or service that the pod is intended to run.
      - Helper/Sidecar container: A secondary container that provides additional functionality or support to the main application. Examples include logging agents, data synchronizers, or other utilities that assist the main application.

<b>Examples</b>

In this example scenario, I am using separate Pods for Application and Database on the same Node.
